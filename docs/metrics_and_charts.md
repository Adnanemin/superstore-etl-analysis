# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Visualization Plan (Python-based)

This document defines the main analytical metrics (KPIs) and visualization strategies that will be used to summarize insights from the Sample Superstore dataset.  
All visualizations will be created using **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas)**.

## 3️⃣ Reporting Notes

- Each visualization will include a **brief textual interpretation** (1–2 sentences) summarizing the insight.  
- KPIs and charts will directly correspond to the five main business questions defined in `questions.md`.  
- All generated figures will be exported as `.png` images and saved in:
